For my homework assignment I made an interactive shopping list that relies on user inputs to put items selected together and calculates the total with state tax at the end. When the function is ran and you are selecting your items, you can type "done" to finish adding items. My automated tests are run in a tests directory using pytest. My workflow is set up and works on github as well.
